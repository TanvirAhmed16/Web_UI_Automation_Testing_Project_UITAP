# Web UI Automation Testing Project (UITAP)

It's a Web UI Automation Testing project based on Python language to handle the major functionalities of a Web platform using Selenium Webdriver.

### Project Details
In this project I have handled some important 
functionalities like- 
- AJAX Data 
- Class Attribute 
- Client Side Delay 
- Dynamic ID 
- Dynamic Table 
- Load Delays 
- Mouse Over 
- Non Breaking Space 
- Overlapped Elements 
- Progress Bar 
- Scrollbers 
- Shadow DOM 
- Keyboard Operations 
- Visibility of elements etc.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Selenium 4
- webdrivers for the browsers you want to use for testing (e.g. ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver)


### Installing

1. Install Python 3.x from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Install Selenium by running the following command in your command prompt/terminal:

```bash
pip install selenium
```
3. Download the appropriate webdrivers for the browsers you want to use for testing. Here are some links to the webdrivers for popular browsers:
  - Chrome: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
  - Firefox: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
  - Edge: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
  - Safari: https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/   

### Running the Tests
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine

2. Navigate to the project directory/Test_Suites in your command prompt/terminal

3. Run the following command to run the tests:

```bash
python -m unittest Tests_Suits.py
```
4. The tests will now run and the results will be displayed in the command prompt/terminal

### Frameworks
- Selenium
- Unittest
- HtmlTestRunner

I have used Selenium Webdriver along with Unittest framework to validate/assert the test cases, created a test suite to execute the test cases and finally I have generated a HTML report for the executed test cases with proper status with the help of HtmlTestRunner.
