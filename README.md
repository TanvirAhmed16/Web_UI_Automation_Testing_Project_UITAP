# Web_UI_Automation_Testing_Project_UITAP
It's a Web UI Automation Testing project based on Python language to handle the major functionalities of a Web platform using Selenium Webdriver. In this project I have handled some important functionalities like-
  => AJAX Data
  => Class Attribute
  => Client Side Delay
  => Dynamic ID
  => Dynamic Table
  => Load Delays
  => Mouse Over
  => Non Breaking Space
  => Overlapped Elements
  => Progress Bar
  => Scrollbers
  => Shadow DOM
  => Keyboard Operations
  => Visibility of elements etc.

I have used Selenium Webdriver along with Unittest framework to validate/assert the test cases, created a test suite to execute the test cases and finally I have generated a HTML report for the executed test cases with proper status by using HtmlTestRunner.
